## Running

### Installation

Copy all files, run `./` or `./index.php`, configure Bumpy Booby and enjoy!

Note: you can delete folder "./public/css/app/", it is useless.

The folder `./database` has to be writable for apache: `chmod -R 777 database`.

**Installation on Spamty server with webhook and "build-sites" by pushing to GitHub.com.**

### Backup

Before any update, it's highly recommended to make a backup. You only need to save folder `./database/`.

### Requirements

Bumpy Booby doesn't support IE 6 & 7. It requires JavaScript to work properly.
